      Inline CSS involves applying style directly to individual HTML elements
      using the style attribute. It allows developers to style elements right
      within the HTML tags. While it may seem convenient for quick styling
      changes, inline CSS has its drawbacks. It can lead to code duplication and
      is challenging to maintain across multiple pages, making it less suitable
      for large-scale projects.

      Internal CSS, on the other hand, involves placing the CSS code within the
      &lt;style&gt; element in the head section of an HTML document. This
      approach allows you to apply styles to multiple elements or classes on a
      single webpage. Internal CSS offers a more organized way of styling,
      making it easier to manage styles for a single page or a small website.
      However, it still lacks the reusability and maintainability that comes
      with external CSS.

    <p id="highlight">
      External CSS is the recommended method for most projects. With external
      CSS, developers create a separate CSS file that contains all the style
      rules for the entire website. This file is then linked to each HTML page
      using the &lt;link&gt; element. External CSS promotes clean and organized
      code, making it easier to maintain and update styles across multiple
      pages. It also enables the use of caching, reducing the load time for
      subsequent visits to the website.
