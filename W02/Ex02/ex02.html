      Borders in CSS are a fundamental component used to enhance the visual
      appearance and structure of elements on a webpage. With borders, web
      developers can create clear distinctions between different sections,
      improve user experience, and add a touch of design to various elements
      like divs, images, and buttons. CSS allows for a wide range of
      customization when it comes to borders, enabling developers to specify the
      border width, style, and color. Common border styles include solid,
      dashed, dotted, and double, each offering a distinct visual effect.
      Additionally, CSS enables the creation of rounded corners, transforming
      rigid shapes into softer, more appealing elements. Whether it's adding a
      subtle outline to a form field or creating eye-catching cards with
      borders, mastering CSS borders is essential for crafting attractive and
      professional-looking web interfaces.

    <p id="padding" class="spacing">
      In CSS, both padding and margins play crucial roles in controlling the
      spacing and layout of elements within a webpage, but they serve distinct
      purposes. Padding is used to create space between the content and the
      border of an element. It adds extra room within the element, allowing you
      to control the distance between the content and the border, thus
      preventing the content from touching the border directly. This is
      particularly useful when you want to create some breathing space around
      the content without affecting the size of the element itself.
    </p>
    <p id="margins" class="spacing">
      On the other hand, margins are used to create space between elements. They
      define the distance between an element and its neighboring elements,
      effectively controlling the layout and positioning of elements within a
      page. Unlike padding, margins are outside of the border box of an element,
      meaning they influence the spacing between elements rather than within the
      element itself.
